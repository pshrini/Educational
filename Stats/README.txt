1. CLM.R
Central Limit Theorem Demonstration. Run the code "as is".
You should see gaussian (normal) distributions for sample means(Due to Central Limit theorem)
The spread in the gaussian reduces with sample size as expected
Try changing 2 things
1.Type of population distribution (Currently Uniform)
2.the number of times the sample size is taken(Currently 100)
